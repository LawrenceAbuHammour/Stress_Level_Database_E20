# StressLevelDatabase
During my second major programming experience at Dartmouth College and the Thayer School of Engineering, I programmed a database which took in a *.csv file which was converted into a *.txt file a read into the database while displayed. The data being sorted is stress level which is fictitious data. The database sorts based on last name and the level of stress while allowing a user to add or delete an entry or save the current version of the database to a *.txt file. Make sure to download the *.txt file which is also uploaded into the repository prior to running the program.
